# 🐍 Recursive and Lambda Functions

Understanding recursive and Lambda functions unlocks powerful and efficient coding strategies in Python. This repository explores recursive functions and their ability to simplify complex problems, sorting algorithms like merge sort that demonstrate recursion's effectiveness, and Lambda functions for writing more concise and streamlined code — through practical examples, pseudocode, and hands-on exercises.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Recursive Functions** — Understanding the structure, mechanics, and best practices for writing recursive functions in Python
- **Lambda Functions** — Writing concise, anonymous function expressions and leveraging them with Python's built-in functions
- **Merge Sort** — Implementing and analysing a recursive divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
- **Linear Sort and Merge** — Exploring linear sorting strategies and how merging fits into recursive solutions

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, I developed the ability to:

- Understand the fundamentals of recursive functions, including their structure and how they work
- Write Lambda functions in Python and understand their syntax, usage, and advantages
- Implement recursive sorting algorithms, with a focus on merge sort
- Apply recursive and Lambda functions for more streamlined and powerful Python programming
- Make informed decisions on when to use recursion or Lambda expressions for cleaner, more efficient code
