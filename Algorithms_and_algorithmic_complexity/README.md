# 🐍 Algorithms and Algorithmic Complexity

Understanding algorithm performance and scalability is essential for writing optimised code, enhancing efficiency, and building robust solutions that can handle increasing data sizes without compromising speed or functionality. This repository covers the fundamentals of computational complexity, Big O notation, and core search and sort algorithms — through practical examples, pseudocode, and hands-on exercises.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Big O Notation** — Understanding how to measure and express algorithm efficiency
- **Computational Complexity** — Analysing time and space complexity of algorithms
- **Search Algorithms** — Exploring linear search, binary search, and their complexities
- **Sort Algorithms** — Implementing and analysing sorting techniques like bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort
- **Pseudocode** — Writing clear pseudocode for search and sort algorithms to foster algorithmic thinking
