Implement the `analyse_carbon_impact` function, which takes **lists** of **deforested areas** and **planted trees**, the **carbon emission factor** and an **offset per tree** as parameters. The function should return one of three categories: `Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`, representing the overall carbon impact."
