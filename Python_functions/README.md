# 🐍 Python Functions

Python functions are pivotal in enhancing code modularity and reusability. They allow developers to encapsulate specific functionality, making code more organised and efficient. This repository covers the fundamentals of Python functions — from defining and calling functions to working with advanced argument patterns — through practical examples and hands-on exercises.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Python Functions** — Understanding what functions are and their importance in programming
- **Basic Python Functions** — Learning how to define and call functions in Python
- **Python Functions 101** — Exploring core function concepts and patterns
- **Function Arguments and Return Values** — Understanding the difference between parameters and arguments, and using `return` statements effectively
- **Kwargs, Args, and Default Values** — Working with `*args`, `**kwargs`, and default parameter values for flexible function signatures
- **More Functions in Python** — Diving deeper into advanced function techniques
- **Loops and Functions** — Combining loop structures with functions for powerful, reusable logic
